    <h1>On the Potential NCAR Closure</h1>
      <p>
          This application gets its weather forecast data from the National Weather Service. Much of the research that these forecasts are based on comes from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). NCAR is an Earth systems research center operated by the nonprofit University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR).

          NCAR works with the National Weather Service to improve weather forecasts (e.g. making new models, improving the user interface). For instance, the weather icons used in this application were made by NCAR.

          Recently, the White House announced that it plans to dismantle NCAR. It has been sparse on details, with even the President of UCAR not knowing what will happen next. If NCAR is dismantled, then many of the researchers working to improve weather forecasts will no longer be able to do so. To be clear, if NCAR is dismantled, then the forecasts on this application will likely stop improving or even reduce in quality.

          If this concerns you, then you can contact your elected officials to let them know. I've placed a link below to a petition by the Union of Concerned Scientists urging Congress to halt NCAR's dismantling. Alternatively, you may contact your elected representatives with a more personal message using <i>USAGov</i>, which I've also linked below.
